                    Australia and booked their berth for the semi-finals.

                    Rohit Sharma put on a show at the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground with a fiery 92 off 41 balls. A
                    quickfire 31 runs off 16 balls from Suryakumar Yadav helped India set a 206-run target for the
                    Aussies.
                    Although Travis Head (76 runs in 43 balls) threatened to ruin India's party once again,
                    wicket-taking spells from Arshdeep Singh (3/37) and Kuldeep Yadav (2/24) helped their side register
                    a 24-run win. 
                In the 2022 Mens T20 World Cup semi-finals, England defeated India decisively with a 10-wicket win. In
                2024, India turned the tables by bowling England out for 103, winning by 68 runs at the Providence
                Stadium in Guyana.

                36 balls) helped India set a 172-run target for England.

                Defending the total, it was the spinners who drove India to a win, restricting England to 103 runs in
                16.4 overs. Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel scalped three wickets each while Bumrah bagged two more.
